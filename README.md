# fclooper

Looper inspired by the DigiTech JamMan, but with the ability to record onto several channels at once, not just to the playback channel. This allows for live performances of musical forms where the oldest layers fall away as the playback channel moves up through the recorded composite loops.

## Goals

* **Simplicity.** It should only take a user a few minutes build up an intuition for what the looper does and how to use it.
* **Flexibility.** Should be able to target hardware (e.g. Daisy) as well as run in a standalone app (on Linux).
* **Extensibility (eventually).** Scriptable interactions are a stretch goal.

## Tests

None so far.

## Architecture

**TODO**

## Development

To start the dev version, just run:

```sh
cargo run
```
